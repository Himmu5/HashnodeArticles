This is the third Article of this series. This series is about the experiences of last month and thinking about the good bad and ugly things in the month. This series can help in getting input from the past and use it to make better me.

The good things are that we need to maintain it as it is. Good things tell us to figure out the things that are going in the right direction and that things do not need to change. Bad things teach us about the things that are not going very well but It can be great it just needs more attention. It motivates me to add some more effort to bad work to make some improvements. And last about the Ugly things I am calling them ugly because we all never want ugly things in our life so Ugly things are work or activities that we never want to repeat.

### The Good

* This month I have completed 300+ questions on Leetcode. Currently, I am solving the Binary Tree question. And things are going well.
    
* As I have already mentioned in my last Good Bad And Ugly blog I was trying to get an internship for a frontend role so In this month I got selected on TGH technologies.
    
* I have completed a Chat App in the MERN stack. the core feature is we can talk to one another by writing messages.
    

### The Bad

* The first Bad thing about this month is during the internship I was not that much consistent with DSA questions so this thing I feel very bad.
    
* Now I have a clear understanding of remote work so I have changed my perception of remote work there are some problems that I want to change and use to improve myself.
    

### The Ugly

* The ugly thing was I was failing to make a balance between work and normal studies. so that thing I never want to repeat.
