Welcome to the fourth installment of my Good Bad and Ugly series, where we delve into the essence of evaluating our past month's experiences and the lessons they brought. In this article, we'll explore the significance of dividing these experiences into three distinct categories: Good, Bad, and Ugly. This unique evaluation technique has the power to bring about profound changes in our personalities, leading to personal growth and development.

We need to understand one more thing what is Good, what is Bad and what is Ugly. We are talking about the Good bad and Ugly so we should have a clear definition of these three things. Good is that things which were going according to the plan or something we should not change. We should keep our good things and remove the bad ones. Bad is that things which are not going according to our plans or not getting expected results. so we should give more attention to Bad things to make some improvements on that. And the last is Ugly, we should remove the ugly things from our habits and have to focus on something better things.

We will talk about the July month experiences in the article. That was totally like a roller coaster for me. This month was too busy for me. I will try to find good bad and ugly things from this month.

### The Good

* The First Good thing was I was working too much this month. During my internship, I was working on multiple projects in parallel. I have seen different coding styles in different projects. I have learned a lot of new things from them.
    
* I have started a new hobby like book reading. Currently, I am reading Rich Dad Poor Dad.
    
* I have worked on some new Technologies like Spring Boot, NextJS etc. That was a very good experience for me.
    

### The Bad

* The First Bad thing about this month was I was working a lot for others so I was stuck in how to manage time for myself.
    
* One bad thing was I am a little inconsistent in writing a blog. I will fix this issue.
    

### The Ugly

* One of the ugly things was in this month I was facing a lot of problems to complete the internship task by some personal issues so I will separate them.
    

### Conclusion

These are some things that happened this month. Some were good for me, some were bad and at the worst point, there are something ugly. There is always some scope for improvement so I will try to solve problems.
