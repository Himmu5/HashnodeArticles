This article is about my learning from my previous month. This series helps me to make some improvements in myself according to my previous experience. This is a technique to examine our strengths and weaknesses and make some improvements on it.

I am writing the series from March and this article is about my experience in June. This month was full of ups and downs things. A lot of things are going on around me like my college exam, Internship work. That was very hard to maintain both things parallel but I managed that.

We need to understand one more thing what is Good, what is Bad and what is Ugly. We are talking about the Good bad and Ugly so we should have a clear definition of these three things. Good is that things which were going according to the plan or something we should not change. We should keep our good things and remove the bad ones. Bad is that things which are not going according to our plans or not getting expected results. so we should give more attention to Bad things to make some improvements on that. And the last is Ugly, we should remove the ugly things from our habits and have to focus on something better things.

### The Good

There are many things I can say that were good in the previous month. I am improving in many things like tech and managing many things side by side.

* The first good thing was I successfully managed my college exam and internship work both partially.
    
* I completed my chat application project this month I have learned many things from this project like API making and web sockets.
    
* Now this month I have started working with more new technologies like Prisma, postgreSQL and NextJS. and I can say these techs are awesome.
    

### The Bad

There are some points which are not going exactly according to me. I am considering that in Bad.

* I am trying to make a habit to learn from official docs and stop watching Youtube tutorials but facing difficulties with it. Now I am referring to 60% of docs and 40% of tutorials and trying to make it 100% to docs reading.
    
* Currently, I am a little diverted from DSA I am skipping that thing now. I am trying to get back to DSA and leetcode.
    

### The Ugly

There are some issues I am facing that I don't want to repeat and trying to remove that thing from life.

* I am feeling some irregularity in blogging so I will try to remove that and again be consistent in blogging.
    

**Conclusion**: There are some good and bad things in our life so we need to learn from both of these things and try to be an improved person every day. This type of self-analysis can be good for the future.
