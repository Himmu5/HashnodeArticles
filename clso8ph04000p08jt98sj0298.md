In this series, we're diving deep into Python, covering everything from the fundamental basics to advanced topics. Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced coder looking to level up your Python skills, this challenge is for you.

Here's what you can expect:

üîπ¬†**Comprehensive Coverage**: We'll explore all the essential topics, starting from basic syntax and data types to more advanced concepts like asynchronous programming and machine learning.

üîπ¬†**Structured Learning**: Each day, we'll focus on a specific topic or concept, making it easy for you to follow along and build your skills incrementally.

üîπ¬†**Hands-On Practice**: Theory is important, but nothing beats hands-on experience. We'll provide plenty of coding exercises and challenges to reinforce your understanding and help you apply what you've learned.

üîπ¬†**Optimized Learning Path**: Our curated curriculum ensures that you learn as efficiently and effectively as possible, saving you time and effort.

### Roadmap

For this series, I have created a basic roadmap. That will help me to check my current learning status.

### **Basic Topics:**

1. Syntax and Basic Data Types (integers, floats, strings, booleans)
    
2. Variables and Assignments
    
3. Operators and Expressions
    
4. Control Flow (if statements, loops)
    
5. Data Structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries)
    
6. Functions and Functional Programming
    
7. Input/Output Handling (I/O)
    
8. Exception Handling
    
9. String Manipulation and Formatting
    
10. List Comprehensions and Generators
    
11. File Handling
    
12. Modules and Packages
    
13. Virtual Environments and Dependency Management
    
14. Basic Debugging Techniques
    

### **Intermediate Topics:**

1. Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
    
2. Regular Expressions (Regex)
    
3. Advanced Data Structures (sets, collections)
    
4. Decorators and Context Managers
    
5. Iterators and Iterables
    
6. Working with Files (CSV, JSON, XML)
    
7. Database Access (SQLite, SQLAlchemy)
    
8. Testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD)
    
9. Functional Programming Concepts (map, filter, reduce)
    
10. Concurrency and Parallelism (Threading, Multiprocessing)
    
11. Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy)
    

### **Advanced Topics:**

1. Asynchronous Programming (asyncio)
    
2. Design Patterns
    
3. Web Development Frameworks (FastAPI, Django)
    
4. API Development and Consumption
    
5. GUI Programming (Tkinter, PyQt)
    
6. Big Data Processing (Apache Spark)
    
7. Networking and Socket Programming
    
8. Deployment and DevOps Practices
    
9. Containerization (Docker)
    
10. Websockets and Real-Time Applications
    

That is the basic structure of this series but this will be flexible about topics. we can add more difficult topics to it.
