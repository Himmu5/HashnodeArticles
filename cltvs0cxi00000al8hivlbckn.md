This blog is part of my Python learning series, specifically focusing on FastAPI, a new web framework. We will delve into building an e-commerce site project using FastAPI, providing hands-on experience in developing APIs with Python. Additionally, we'll incorporate technologies such as Docker, AWS, and Kubernetes, enhancing the project's scalability and deployment capabilities.

### FastAPI

FastAPI is a modern web development framework designed for building APIs with Python 3.8+ using standard Python type hints. It was first released on December 5, 2018. Notably, FastAPI boasts superior speed compared to older Python frameworks like Django.

**Features of FastAPI**

* **Fast**: FastAPI is more faster then the other framework like Nodejs, or Go.
    
* **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%.
    
* **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
    
* **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
