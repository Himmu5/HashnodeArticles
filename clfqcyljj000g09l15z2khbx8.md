**React** is a popular JavaScript library for building web applications, which is widely used by developers worldwide. Unlike a traditional JavaScript website, a React application uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to render updates efficiently and optimize performance.

In a traditional JavaScript website, when a user interacts with the page, the browser updates the DOM, which can be time-consuming and impact performance. In contrast, React uses a virtual DOM, which is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. When the state of a React component changes, React updates the virtual DOM instead of directly updating the actual DOM. This makes the updates much faster and more efficient, as the virtual DOM only updates the parts of the page that need to be changed.

Another key difference between a React application and a traditional JavaScript website is the use of reusable components. React allows developers to break down the user interface into smaller, reusable components, which can be used throughout the application. This not only saves development time but also improves code maintainability and makes it easier to scale the application.

In summary, a React application is different from a traditional JavaScript website in several ways. It uses a virtual DOM to optimize performance and allows for the use of reusable components, making it a popular choice for building complex web applications.
