In this blog, we'll delve into the realm of database access in Python, focusing on SQLite and leveraging SQLAlchemy. As databases play a pivotal role in most projects, mastering database access is crucial. We'll explore the fundamentals of databases and delve into the tools necessary for establishing connections. By understanding these concepts and tools, you'll be equipped to seamlessly navigate database operations within your projects.

### Database

A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a computer system. It is designed to efficiently manage, retrieve, and manipulate data according to the needs of an application or organization.

type of databases:

* **Relational Databases (RDBMS):** Relational databases store data in a structured manner, typically organized into tables within the database. These tables establish relationships with each other, forming the foundation of the relational model. This structured approach enables efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data, facilitating seamless data management and analysis.  
    Examples: SQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite.
    
* **NoSQL Databases**: NoSQL databases offer a departure from the rigid structure of relational databases by providing a schema-less approach to data storage. Instead of fixed tables, NoSQL databases use collections to store data, each independent of one another. This schema flexibility eliminates the need for predefined data models, allowing for dynamic and evolving data structures. As a result, developers are liberated from the constraints of traditional schemas, enabling faster iteration and adaptation to changing requirements.
    
    Examples: MongoDB, Couchbase, CouchDB.
    
* **In-Memory Databases**: In-memory databases primarily store data in RAM for faster access speeds. They are suitable for applications requiring high performance and low latency. Examples include Redis, Memcached, and SAP HANA.
    

### SQLAlchemy

This is an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) tool designed to harness the full power of SQL while providing a seamless integration with Python. It offers a comprehensive suite of enterprise-level persistence patterns, meticulously crafted to facilitate efficient and high-performing database access. By blending sophisticated SQL capabilities with a simple Pythonic domain language, it empowers developers to interact with databases effortlessly, streamlining the development process and enhancing productivity.

### Access SQLite with SQLAlchemy

* Install SQLAlchemy:
    
    ```sql
    pip install SQLAlchemy
    ```
    
    * Create an SQLite database: To access the SQLite database I will create a docker container instead of installing it on the local system.
        
        ```sql
        pip install sqlalchemy
        ```
        
        ```sql
        from sqlalchemy import create_engine
        
        # Replace 'sqlite:///mydatabase.db' with the path to your SQLite database file
        engine = create_engine('sqlite:///mydatabase.db')
        ```
        
    * **Create a Session**: Next, create a session object using the `sessionmaker` function. This session will be used to interact with the database:
        
        ```sql
        from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
        
        Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
        session = Session()
        ```
        
    * **Execute Queries**: You can now execute SQL queries using the session object. Here's an example of creating a table and inserting data into it:
        
        ```sql
        from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
        from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
        
        # Define the base class for declarative ORM models
        Base = declarative_base()
        
        # Define your model
        class User(Base):
            __tablename__ = 'users'
            id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
            name = Column(String)
        
        # Create the table in the database
        Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
        
        # Insert data into the table
        user = User(name='John Doe')
        session.add(user)
        session.commit()
        ```
        
    * **Query Data**: You can query data from the database using SQLAlchemy's query API. Here's an example of querying all users from the `users` table:
        
        ```sql
        users = session.query(User).all()
        for user in users:
            print(user.name)
        ```
