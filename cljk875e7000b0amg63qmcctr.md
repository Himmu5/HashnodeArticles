In this article, I will try to explain and make something to give you a practical example of how ReactJS and NEXTJs are a deadly combination. This will be a basic overview of NextJS. Also, We will discuss a small project in the current blog. we will create a Todo application using NEXTJS and ReactJs. This blog can create a good understanding of the NEXTJS so be with me.

NEXTJS is a React Framework that is used to render the React code on the server side. NextJs helps us to focus on coding instead of tooling. It can create SEO friendly site that is good for blogging or an e-commerce site.

**NextJS rendering types**

* Client-side rendering
    
* Server-side rendering
    

With this Framework we can render our code on both sides. both of these have their own use cases.

### Setup nextJS project

For the setup NextJS project, we need at least a 16.8 version. Official docs are recommending create-next-app method. It can automatically install everything for you.

To create a project:run

```typescript
npx create-next-app@latest
```

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

1. What is your project named?
    
2. my-appWould you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
    
3. Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
    
4. Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
    
5. Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes
    
6. Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
    
7. Would you like to customize the default import alias? No / Yes
    

**Conclution** : NEXTJS is a complete package for Reactjs. It solve the react problems and makes it more optimize. I will come back with a complete series of NextJS.
